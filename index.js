            I've been in charge of a team of 12 developers which delivered multiple projects, the biggest one being the total refactoring of our main app, 
            we migrated everything towards a more modern stack. This app also was split in multiple components based on responsabilities,
            we had a component library, a client app and a WebGL based game engine. This was built using PIXI, React and Redux, the main
            challenge of the project was coordination and the modularity of everything, keeping it simple, yet make it do a lot.
